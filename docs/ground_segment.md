# 🌍 Feza-X: Ground Segment & MCC Interface

The Ground Segment architecture for managing the Feza-X CubeSat mission.

## 1. Mission Control Center (MCC) Architecture
- **Infrastructure:** Centralized server for TLE (Two-Line Element) tracking and pass prediction.
- **Software Stack:** Python-based PDU (Protocol Data Unit) decoder + InfluxDB for telemetry storage + Grafana for real-time health monitoring.

## 2. Telemetry & Command Pipeline
